Here are 20 algorithm questions designed to test your knowledge of loops, conditions, functions, array length and indexes, dot notation, and operators—<b> _without using array or string methods_</b> (like push, pop, split, join, etc.):

1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the numbers.
2. Write a function that takes an array and returns the largest number in the array.
3. Write a function that counts how many even numbers are in an array.
4. Write a function that returns the index of the first negative number in an array, or -1 if there are none.
5. Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with only the positive numbers.
6. Write a function that checks if a given number exists in an array.
7. Write a function that takes an array and returns the smallest number in the array.
8. Write a function that counts how many times a specific value appears in an array.
9. Write a function that returns true if all numbers in an array are greater than 10, otherwise false.
10. Write a function that finds the sum of all odd numbers in an array.
11. Write a function that takes an array and returns the average of the numbers.
12. Write a function that finds the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in an array.
13. Write a function that takes an array and returns a new array with all numbers multiplied by 2.
14. Write a function that returns the last element of an array.
15. Write a function that takes an array and a number, and returns true if the number is found at an even index.
16. Write a function that counts how many numbers in an array are greater than a given value.
17. Write a function that returns the sum of numbers at even indexes in an array.
18. Write a function that takes an array and returns true if the array is sorted in ascending order.
19. Write a function that takes an array and returns the second largest number.
20. Write a function that takes an array and returns the number of elements that are both positive and even.
21. Write a function that counts how many times a specific character appears in a string.
22. Write a function that returns the number of vowels in a string.
23. Write a function that reverses a string and returns the reversed version.
24. Write a function that checks if a string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).
25. Write a function that counts the number of words in a string, assuming words are separated by a single space.

These questions will help you practice using loops, conditions, functions, array length and indexes, dot notation, and operators—without relying on built-in array or string methods.

// variables are usedto store data that can be used throughout the applications .
//They can be used to store configuration settings, user preferences ,or any other data
//  that needs to be accesed globally

//In js we can create variable using 'var' ,'let' or 'const' keywords

//Keywords in programing languages are reserved words that have special meaning in the language.They are used to defune the structure and brehaviour of the code 
// .In javasript keywords include 'var' , 'let , 'const' , 'funtion' , 'if' , 'else' , 'for , 'while'  and many more others.

//Var was the original way to declare variables in javascrit, Because of scope issues it is now recomended to use let and const instead
var username ="TONNY"

//Let is used to declare variables that can be reassigned later .It has b;lock sco[pe, meaning it is only assecible within the block it is derfined in
let age=30;

//const is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned.It also block scoped
const pi =3.14;
const role = "distributor"
let darkmode =false;
//let variables can be reassigned ,but const variables cannot be reassigned.
age = 31;
//pi = 3.2;

// Javascript provides a rich set of methods to manipulate arrays, allowing developers to perform various operations such as adding, removing, and transforming elements.
// Example reversing an array
const users = [
  "Alice",
  "Bob",
  "Charlie",
  "David",
  "Zachary",
  "Frank",
  "Grace",
  "Heidi",
  "Ivan",
  "Judy",
];

console.log(users.reverse());
console.log(users.sort());
users.push(true);

console.log(users);

const nums = [23, 233, 3, 4, 3, 2, 88, 65, 2, 4];

console.log(Math.max(...nums));

// Math, Date, Number, JSON, RegExp, Array, String, Error ........

console.log(new Date().toLocaleDateString()); // Returns the current timestamp in milliseconds since January 1, 1970 - Epoch time


// In js , almost everything is an object, including arrays. Arrays are a special type of object that allows you to store and manipulate collections of data. They are used to hold multiple values in a single variable, making it easier to work with lists of items.
